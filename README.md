# Matter Heater

Based initially on the [ESP matter refridgerator example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-matter/tree/96dc30b06e6330f84716f1954d51dd966486b071/examples/refrigerator).

This is used to control a simple electric radiant heater I have by directly switching an AC relay.

Built using an ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 board, a DS18B20 temperature sensor, and a SSR-40DA 40A 250V solid state relay.

See the [docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-matter/en/latest/esp32c3/developing.html) for more information about building and flashing the firmware.
